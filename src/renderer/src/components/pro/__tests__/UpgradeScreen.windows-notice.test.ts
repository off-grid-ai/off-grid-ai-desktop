/**
 * Guards the "coming soon to your device" notice on the Pro UPGRADE (buy) screen.
 *
 * A prospective buyer on a platform where a feature isn't live yet must be told so -
 * otherwise they could buy expecting it to run locally. The notice is now gated
 * PER FEATURE (`platformNotice`, computed from `featureSupportsPlatform` +
 * `currentPlatform`), not a blanket `!isMac()`: a feature that IS ported to this
 * platform (e.g. Vault on Windows) shows no warning, while a not-yet-ported feature
 * still does. This is a source-reading guard - the repo has no React render harness
 * (no jsdom/testing-library), so we assert the wiring + copy by reading the
 * component, matching the pattern in main/__tests__/extract-prompt.test.ts.
