// Static catalogue of the Pro SETTINGS sections — the settings-screen analogue of
// proCatalog.ts (which does the same for the sidebar nav). Core owns the slot list,
// the render order, and the free-build placeholder copy; the pro package registers
// the REAL section components against these ids via the section-registry seam
// (bootstrap/sectionRegistry). This keeps pro section LOGIC out of the public core
// repo — core carries only the inert placeholder shell and renders whichever slots
// pro has filled.
//
// Free build: each slot with placeholder copy renders a dimmed ProPlaceholder; a
// slot with `placeholder: null` (e.g. "Your Pro plan") renders nothing until pro
// registers it. Pro build: core renders the registered section component in the
// slot's position.
