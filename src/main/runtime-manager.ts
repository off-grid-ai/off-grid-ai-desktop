// The single seam every on-device model runtime goes through for residency. There
// is ONE place that turns a residency mode into behavior; every engine (LLM, image,
// STT, TTS) implements the same ManagedRuntime interface and registers the same way.
// So if residency works for one engine it works for all, and if it breaks it breaks
// for all — no per-engine special-casing to drift out of sync (DSP + SRP).
//
// Two aspects of residency, both driven off the same getResidencyMode source:
//   1. Memory management (here): the queue evicts a runtime before a competing
//      heavy job and, when that job finishes, re-warms it MODE-AWARE via this seam.
//   2. Job execution (in each engine's run path): a 'resident' engine routes work
//      through its warm server; an 'on-demand' engine uses its one-shot path. Each
//      engine reads getResidencyMode(modality) — the same rule, applied once per side.
