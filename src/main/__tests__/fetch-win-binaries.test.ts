/**
 * Regression guard for the Windows image-gen "binary not found" bug.
 *
 * scripts/fetch-win-binaries.ps1 populates resources/bin/sd/sd-cli.exe from an
 * upstream stable-diffusion.cpp release asset, matched by NAME. The sd fetch is
 * OPTIONAL (the script's verify block only WARNs when sd-cli.exe is missing), so
 * a stale asset pattern fails SILENTLY at build time: `Get-AssetUrl` throws "no
 * asset matching", the try/catch swallows it into a warning, and the Windows
 * package ships with NO image binary — surfacing only at runtime as
 *   "Image generation binary (sd-cli) not found in resources/bin/sd."
 * (src/main/imagegen.ts:findSdCli -> throw).
 *
 * That is exactly what happened: upstream retired `bin-win-avx2-x64.zip`. This
 * test fails if the script ever references that dead asset again, and asserts it
 * matches a currently-published Windows asset instead.
