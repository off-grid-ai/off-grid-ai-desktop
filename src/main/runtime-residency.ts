// Residency policy for the on-device model runtimes. Each modality can run in one
// of two modes, user-selectable in settings and enforced by the ModalityQueue:
//
//   'resident'  — the model stays warm in memory between jobs (low latency), and is
//                 evicted ONLY when another modality needs the RAM (queue admission),
//                 then re-warmed when the slot frees.
//   'on-demand' — the model loads for a job and is freed right after (frees RAM,
//                 higher per-job latency). The default for the heavy image/STT paths.
//
// Concrete engines map onto these: LLM = llama-server; image = sd-cli/sd-server or
// mflux; STT = whisper-cli / whisper-server (resident) / parakeet; TTS = kokoro.
//
// Pure policy lives in runtime-residency-logic.ts. This module is the thin SQLite
// settings wrapper used by production runtimes.
