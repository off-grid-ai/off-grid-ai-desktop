// ModalityQueue — the memory-admission scheduler for heavy model work.
//
// On a 16GB unified-memory Mac two big models resident at once (chat + image, or
// chat + replay-vision) overflow RAM and swap the whole machine into a beachball.
// This queue serializes heavy jobs by PRIORITY (see policy.ts) and evicts named
// engines before a job runs, so only one heavy model is resident at a time. It
// generalizes the ad-hoc llm.pause()/resume() bracketing that imagegen.ts did
// inline: engines register themselves as evictable, jobs declare what they evict.
//
// SOLID: this file is the thin IO layer (async/await + eviction hooks + state);
// ALL ordering/admission decisions live in the pure policy.ts and are called from
// here. It never imports llm/image/capture — those register through the hooks.
