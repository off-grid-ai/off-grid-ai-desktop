// Decide the chat (llama-server) health status shown in System Health. Kept pure
// + Electron-free so it's unit-testable (see __tests__/chat-health.test.ts).
//
// The motivating bug: while a model loads (several seconds at -ngl 99),
// llama-server's /health returns HTTP 503 ("loading model"), so the HTTP probe
// reports not-healthy AND the server isn't "ready" yet — and the old logic fell
// straight to "down: server is not running". Users opened Settings mid-load and
// saw a scary red "Down" on a server that was simply warming up. This distinguishes
// "alive but loading" (starting) from "genuinely not running" (down).
