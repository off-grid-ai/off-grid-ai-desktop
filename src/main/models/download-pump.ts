// It owns the failure the naive inline loop got wrong (D1): a write error (disk
// full / EIO) emits an 'error' event on the stream. With NO 'error' listener that
// becomes an UNHANDLED exception and crashes the whole main process; and 'finish'
// never fires after an error, so awaiting it would HANG the download forever.
// pumpToFile attaches the listener and turns a write error into a normal
// rejection, so the caller reports the download failed instead of crashing.
