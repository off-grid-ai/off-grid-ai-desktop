# Gaps backlog

Honest log of gaps, regressions, and "not fully done" items. Each entry: what, evidence,
how to reproduce, and the fix direction. Close with evidence; never hide.

## OPEN

_None._ The data-layer/presentation-layer drift sweep (2026-07-09) is fully closed - see RESOLVED
below. No open bugs or regressions tracked.

### Data-layer / presentation-layer drift sweep (2026-07-09) - CLOSED

Class: the UI kept its own copy of authoritative data instead of binding to the owning source
(hygiene §A). Every TIER-1 item is fixed, behavior-neutral where required, and regression-tested;
the coverage floor held (~97/92/96/98) throughout.

- **T1a. Image composer `imgModel` shadowed the active model** → FIXED. The dropdown's `onChange`
  now writes through the single owner (`MemoryChat.tsx:553` `setActiveModalModel('image', value)`)
  and the composer reads the active value from `imageGenStatus().active` (no latch). Terminal-artifact
  render test: `MemoryChat.image.test.tsx` asserts a dropdown change routes through
  `setActiveModalModel` and reaches the `generateImage` payload.
- **T1b. `imgSteps`/`imgSize` re-seed stomp** → FIXED. Per-model overrides resolved by the pure
  `resolveImageParams`/`setOverride` (`lib/image-params.ts`), persisted via
  `saveSetting('imageParams', …)`; a model change never clobbers a typed value. Render test asserts
  the payload carries the user's steps (10), not the model default (28).
- **T1c. `imgSeed`/`imgNegative`/`imgStrength`/`imgStyle` not persisted** → FIXED. Persisted +
  reloaded through the data layer (`MemoryChat.tsx:314-317, 332-335`). (`imgInit` stays transient  - 
  a per-turn init-image path, correctly not persisted.)
- **T1d. Image params had no persisted owner** → FIXED (subsumed by T1a–T1c). Image-gen params now
  have a single persisted owner (the settings store); the composer binds to it and writes through.
  A separate Settings > Image editor is optional UX, not a drift bug - descoped, not a gap.
- **T1e. KV cache / FlashAttn / ctxSize two-writer clobber via the mode preset** → FIXED.
  `applyModePreset` (`llm/settings-math.ts`) MERGES - it only fills fields the user has NOT pinned;
  the pinned set (`userExplicit`) is persisted (`llm.ts:194`) and restored on boot (`:125-126`), and
  boot loads the stored `kvCacheType`/`flashAttn` DIRECTLY (never re-derived from the mode), so the
  every-restart re-clobber path is closed too. Tests: `llm/__tests__/settings-merge.test.ts` +
  `kv-launch-roundtrip.test.ts` (persist → restart → launch-args round-trip).
- **T1f. Thinking/reasoning not persisted** → FIXED. Reasoning rides the persisted context blob via
  `buildAssistantContext`/`readReasoning` (`lib/message-persistence.ts`) and is restored on remap.
  Real DB round-trip test: `lib/__tests__/message-persistence.test.ts`.

### TIER 2 (minor / adjacent) - dispositioned

- **Preload `setLlmSettings` type omitted kvCacheType/flashAttn/gpuLayers/threads/batchSize/mode** →
  FIXED (`src/preload/index.ts:244` - the type now carries every field the handler accepts;
  runtime was always passing the whole object, this closes the type-check blind spot).
- **Settings identity fields saved on `blur` only (edit lost if closed without blurring)** → FIXED  - 
  now also commits on Enter (`Settings.tsx:472-473`), the standard keyboard commit, calling the same
  `saveIdentity`.
- **`ctxSize` halved + persisted by crash recovery (`llm.ts:479-483`)** → BY DESIGN, not a bug. This
  is the deliberate post-crash safety fallback (a too-large KV cache froze macOS on 16GB); it
  intentionally persists a smaller, safe context after a detected crash. Left as-is.
- **VoiceScreen residency toggle fire-and-forget; ActionsScreen prop-resync** → minor UI polish, NOT
  the data-layer drift class (no authoritative copy that diverges). Deferred as cosmetic; would need
  on-device screenshot verification if ever pursued.

### TIER 3 (ephemeral view prefs) - BY DESIGN

ReplayScreen `speed`/`asideW`, ReflectScreen day/week `mode` reset on remount. No authoritative owner
to diverge from - explicitly not the drift class. Persisting them is optional UX, not a gap.

### Reference pattern (correct write-through / refetch-bound)

SettingsPanel (LLM inference controls), ModelPicker (per-modality active model), Projects, Connectors,
ChatDetail, DayView (persisted layout with get + write-back - the good reference), MeetingsScreen,
ReflectScreen, composer chat-prefs (noMemory/tools/connectors/thinking/voice).

### Agentic `generate_image` tool errored (stale keep-alive socket in the tool loop) - CLOSED

**Root cause (verified with in-process DIAG):** the tool loop makes back-to-back requests to
llama-server. Round 0 (`generate_image`) succeeded; round 1's `streamChat` died with `read
ECONNRESET`. Node's global HTTP agent pooled the round-0 socket; llama-server closes its socket after
each response, so the pooled socket was half-closed and round 1's write reset. (The earlier
"modality queue evicts llm mid-loop" hypothesis was DISPROVED - DIAG confirmed the engine stayed
alive; pause was never called.)

**Fix:** every `http.request` to the model uses a fresh connection (`agent: false` +
`Connection: close`); the SSE transport is now one shared `streamCompletion` (`llm/stream.ts`) used
by both `chatStream` and `streamChat`. Regression guards: `__tests__/llm-http-no-keepalive.test.ts`
(reads the source, asserts no keep-alive pool) + `llm/__tests__/stream.test.ts` (a real local SSE
server exercises content/reasoning/tool-calls/abort/timeout). The double intent-decision that could
route "draw …" away from the tool was also closed (`shouldAutoRouteImage` suppresses the renderer
auto-route when the agentic path owns the turn; `image-intent.test.ts` + `MemoryChat.image.test.tsx`
assert tools-ON → `toolChat`, not a direct `generateImage`).
