# Off Grid AI — Features

A deep dive on everything the free, open-source app does. All of it runs **on your
device** — no cloud inference, no account, no API key. Each feature has its own page:

## The studio

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| [The Gateway](features/gateway.md) | One local OpenAI-compatible API for every model — chat, vision, image, audio, embeddings. |
| [Chat](features/chat.md) | Text + vision + reasoning, streaming, tabs, tools, voice mode, project scoping. |
| [Image generation](features/image-generation.md) | Text→image and image→image (SDXL GGUFs), styles, LoRA, live previews. |
| [Voice & speech](features/voice.md) | Speech→text (whisper) and text→speech (Kokoro), hands-free voice mode. |
| [Projects (RAG)](features/projects.md) | Group chats, upload docs, chat grounded in them with cited retrieval. |
| [Artifacts](features/artifacts.md) | HTML / React / SVG / Mermaid / Markdown rendered in a sandboxed canvas. |
| [Connectors (MCP)](features/connectors.md) | Add Model Context Protocol servers (none / token / OAuth), use them in chat. |
| [Models](features/models.md) | Curated, size-bucketed catalog + Hugging Face search; per-modality active model. |

## Platform

| Topic | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Privacy & data](features/privacy.md) | 100% local inference, encryption at rest, fully offline. |
| [Architecture (open core)](features/architecture.md) | The AGPL core, the `pro/` submodule, and the `activate()` seam. |
| [Off Grid Pro](features/pro.md) | The sees / remembers / acts layer — **coming July 2026**. |
