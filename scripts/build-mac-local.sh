# Local macOS test builds — produces BOTH the core (free) and pro DMGs from a
# single checkout, AD-HOC SIGNED and WITHOUT notarization or GitHub publishing, so you
# can smoke-test the packaged app before any real release.
#
#   - Developer ID discovery/notarization are skipped so there are no cert/Apple-ID
#     prompts. `mac.identity=-` makes electron-builder ad-hoc sign AFTER it mutates
#     Electron fuses; skipping that final sign produces a CODESIGNING Invalid Page
#     crash in Electron Framework. Gatekeeper still treats ad-hoc builds as unsigned.
#   - --publish never: nothing touches GitHub.
#   - Core uses OFFGRID_FORCE_CORE=1 so the pro/ submodule (present in this
#     checkout) is aliased to the stub, exactly like a real free build.
#
# Output: dist/OffGrid-core-<version>.dmg and dist/OffGrid-pro-<version>.dmg
#
# Usage:  ./scripts/build-mac-local.sh           (both)
#         ./scripts/build-mac-local.sh core       (core only)
#         ./scripts/build-mac-local.sh pro        (pro only)
