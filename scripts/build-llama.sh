# Build llama-server from source with a PINNED macOS deployment target, so the
# bundled engine runs on the macOS versions our users actually have — not just
# whatever SDK the build machine happens to use.
#
# Why this exists: a prior release shipped a llama-server compiled on a macOS-26
# toolchain with no deployment target, so it inherited `minos 26.0` and refused
# to launch on macOS 13/14/15 → "Chat model Down" for most users. Even the
# official llama.cpp release binaries are now minos 26. The only reliable fix is
# to build it ourselves with the target pinned. Run in CI before packaging.

#    are bulletproof through electron-builder packaging + codesigning; symlinks
#    inside a signed .app are a "should work" we don't need to gamble on.
