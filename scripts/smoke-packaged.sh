# PACKAGED smoke gate - the missing link that lets packaged-only bugs ship to users.
#
# tsc + unit tests + `npm run dev` ALL pass while the ASSEMBLED .app is broken: an
# app.getAppPath()/asar lookup, a spawn cwd pointing inside the asar, a bundled asset the
# code can't find at its packaged path. Two shipped to every user undetected - TTS
# `spawn ENOTDIR` (asar-file cwd) and a blank menu-bar (icon.png resolved into the asar) -
# on top of 3 prior engine failures. None of the pre-existing gates run the REAL bundle.
#
# This launches the built .app on a throwaway profile and asserts (a) the bundled assets
# are where the code looks and (b) every engine actually works end-to-end over the gateway.
# The TTS runtime probe also transitively proves resourceFile() resolves the packaged
# Resources dir - the exact mechanism the tray icon depends on. Exits non-zero on any
# failure, so it drops straight into release.yml before signing.
