# Build whisper.cpp's `whisper-server` from source with a PINNED macOS deployment
# target, so the bundled RESIDENT speech-to-text engine runs on the macOS versions
# our users actually have - not just whatever SDK the build machine happens to use.
#
# Why this exists: today STT is one-shot CLIs (whisper-cli, sherpa-onnx-offline)
# that RELOAD the whole model on every call (~3.3s), so live/sliding-window
# dictation thrashes and lags. whisper-server keeps ONE model resident across
# requests (loaded once, stays warm) and serves transcription over localhost HTTP,
# so interim ticks skip the reload entirely.
#
# This MIRRORS scripts/build-llama.sh exactly - same pinned deployment target,
# same three gates (minos, dependency-closure, foreign-dep), same "stage real
# files, never symlinks" rule - because the bundled engine has shipped broken to
# users three times and each failure mode has a gate here now. Run in CI before
# packaging (release.yml), NOT from the committed/LFS binary.
#
# Reuses the existing ggml whisper models the app already downloads - this builds
# ONLY the server binary, no new model download.
