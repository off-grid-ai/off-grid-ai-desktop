# DB integration tests (src/main/__tests__/*.dbtest.ts) exercise the real data layer against
# a temp SQLite DB. They need better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers built for the TEST RUNNER's node
# ABI - but the app builds it for ELECTRON's ABI (via electron-builder install-app-deps). So:
# rebuild for node, run the tests, then ALWAYS restore Electron's build - even on failure or
# interrupt - so the Electron app is never left with a mismatched native module.
#
# Kept OUT of the default `npm test` (those files are *.dbtest.ts, not *.test.ts) precisely
# because of this ABI swap. Run it explicitly: `npm run test:db`. A CI job that runs it must
# do so in an isolated step (the rebuild mutates node_modules).
# -e: abort on any failure (e.g. `npm rebuild` failing) so we never run the tests against a stale
# ABI. The EXIT trap below still fires on abort, so Electron's build is restored either way.
